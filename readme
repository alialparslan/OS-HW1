There is no way to maintain position of a character or a point because
when scroll happens line numbers change and when windows resized line and column indexes may change
Therefore we have to keep track of how much character we have writting from point that we want to able to go back
The problem is characters may take up variable widths and there is no way to know it from character code or something
The fonts that every character has same with called monospaced so in order to this app work properly monospaced fonts
has to be used.

What happens if 2width character starts at end of the line -1 ?

Birden çok yer kaplayan bir karakter satır sonuna denk gelirse bir alan boş kalıyor.

Binary    Hex          Comments
0xxxxxxx  0x00..0x7F   Only byte of a 1-byte character encoding
10xxxxxx  0x80..0xBF   Continuation byte: one of 1-3 bytes following the first
110xxxxx  0xC0..0xDF   First byte of a 2-byte character encoding
1110xxxx  0xE0..0xEF   First byte of a 3-byte character encoding
11110xxx  0xF0..0xF7   First byte of a 4-byte character encoding


If \n\r printed to end of the line when terminal size changes it will make problem
Same also goes for using movements. So best way is printing a charater and deleting it.
